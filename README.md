 Hello there, I'm **Noah**.
4th year Software Engineering student.
Looking for my first full-time job as a SW engineer.

 :sparkles: Main focus:

   * [SmartScript](https://github.com/AvielCo/Final-Project) is my final prject as a part of my curriculum. Its main focus is building a program that's capable of classifying ancient hebrew scripts. Later on this year the focus will shift towards combining **ReactJS and Django** to create a website that will be available for paleographers to use in order to enable them to classify Hebrew texts more conveniently.
   * My portfolio website. I decided to develop using **HTML, CSS and Javascript** only to have stronger foundations and focus on making the website responsive.
   
 :thinking: Side hustle
  * My goal is to become a FullStack dev in the future. Therefore, I've been working on HTML, CSS and Javascript to have a good starting base.
  * Shifting focus soon to ReactJS and Django for my degree's final project.
  * Improving Python skills to improve SmartScript's results.
  * Getting more involved in _**open source**_ projects. So far, I've contributed to several repositories by opening issues and to others by reviewing and adding my own PRs. However, I would like be a part of a bigger project consistently.

  On my free time I love playing my guitar :metal: and to work on my cosplay projects. So, if you're looking to jam or work together on some cosplay projects? Talk to me :smiley: Always got time for those hobbies!
