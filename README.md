 Hello there, I'm **Noah**.
4th year Software Engineering student.
Looking for my first full-time job as a SW engineer.

 :sparkles: Main focus:

   * [SmartScript](https://github.com/AvielCo/Final-Project) is my final project as a part of my curriculum. Its main focus is building a program that's capable of classifying ancient hebrew scripts. Later on this year the focus will shift towards combining **ReactJS and Django** to create a website that will be available for paleographers to use in order to enable them to classify Hebrew texts more conveniently.
   * Volunteering at `Coda -  Developing Meaning`. I am taking part in deveoping a web app for chronic patients to help them track different measurements. In this project I am improving my skills with **React** and **Firebase**. Additionally, I started learning how to work with **Typescript** with **Redux** while working on this project .
   
 :thinking: Side hustle
  * My goal is to become a FullStack dev in the future. Therefore, I've been working on HTML, CSS and Javascript to have a good starting base.
  * Working on MERN stack skills.
  * Getting more involved in _**open source**_ projects. So far, I've contributed to several repositories by opening issues and to others by reviewing and adding my own PRs. However, I would like be a part of a bigger project consistently.

  On my free time I love playing my guitar :metal: and to work on my cosplay projects. So, if you're looking to jam or work together on some cosplay projects? Talk to me :smiley: Always got time for those hobbies!
