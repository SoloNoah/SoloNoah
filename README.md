 Hello there, I'm **Noah**.
4th year Software Engineering student.
Looking for my first full-time job as a SW engineer.

 :sparkles: Main focus:

   * [SmartScript](https://github.com/AvielCo/Final-Project) is my final prject. It's main focus is building a program that's capable of classifying ancient hebrew scripts. Later on this year the focus will shift towards combining **ReactJS and Django** to create a website that will be available for paleographers to use.
   * My personal portfolio - I've been working on my portfolio lately. I decided to develop using **HTML, CSS and Javascript** only to have stronger foundations and focus on making the website responsive.
   
 :thinking: Side hustle
  * I'm aiming at a future full stack dev position so I've been working on HTML, CSS and Javascript to have a good starting base.
  * Going to shift focus soon to ReactJS for my degree's final project.
  * Improving python skills to improve SmartScript's results.
  * Getting more involved in _**open source**_ projects. So far, I contriubuted to sevral repositories by opening issues and to others by reviewing and adding my own PRs. But I would like be a part of a bigger project consistently.
